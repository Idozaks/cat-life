# Cat Life

Cat Life is an interactive 3D game where you control a cat in a virtual environment. The game is built using Python, Pygame, and OpenGL.

## Current Features

1. **3D Cat Model**: A 3D cat model that can be controlled by the player.

2. **Movement Controls**:
   - Arrow Up: Move forward
   - Arrow Left/Right: Rotate the cat
   - Shift: Accelerate (increase speed)

3. **Special Moves**:
   - Space: Jump (hold for higher jumps)
   - F: Front Flip
   - B: Backflip
   - T: Turn 180 degrees

4. **Physics and Collision Detection**:
   - Gravity simulation for jumping and falling
   - Collision detection with objects in the environment

5. **3D Environment**:
   - Textured ground
   - 3D box obstacle that the cat can jump on

6. **Camera System**:
   - Third-person camera that follows the cat
   - Smooth camera transitions

7. **User Interface**:
   - FPS counter
   - Speed and acceleration display
   - Speedometer
   - Controls information

8. **Debug Features**:
   - Visible hitboxes for collision detection (bright magenta color)

## Technical Implementations

- Utilizes OpenGL for 3D rendering
- Custom OBJ file loader for 3D models
- Implements a basic physics system for movement and jumps
- Uses Pygame for window management and input handling
- Custom collision detection system for rotated 3D boxes

## Planned Features

- More diverse environments and obstacles
- Additional cat animations and behaviors
- Sound effects and background music
- Level design and progression system
