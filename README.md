- [x] Supports keyboard and mouse input
- [x] Dynamic character animations and interactions
- [x] Multi-level progression system
- [x] Customizable settings and user preferences

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame 2.0+ (if applicable)
- Additional libraries (e.g., `PyOpenGL`, `Panda3D`, `Ursina`) if using alternative game engines.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Game

To start the game, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

The game will launch in a new window. Use the arrow keys or `WASD` to move the character. Press the spacebar to interact with objects in the game.

### Available Commands

- `python main.py --fullscreen`: Launch the game in fullscreen mode.
- `python main.py --debug`: Run the game in debug mode, logging extra details.

## Configuration

All game settings can be configured via the `config.yaml` file located in the root directory. Options include:

- Screen resolution
- Audio volume levels
- Input key bindings

Modify the file as needed, then restart the game to apply changes.

### Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml
screen:
  width: 1920
  height: 1080
  fullscreen: false

audio:
  master_volume: 0.8
  music_volume: 0.5

controls:
  move_up: "W"
  move_down: "S"
  move_left: "A"
  move_right: "D"
  interact: "space"
```

## Examples

Here are some sample commands to run the project in different modes:

1. **Standard Mode:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Debug Mode:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --debug
   ```

3. **Fullscreen Mode:**
